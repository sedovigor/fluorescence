# fluorescence
A Mathematica notebook that can be used to fit the experimental fluorescence quenching data to a given protein-ligand binding model (the most common 1:1 model is employed in this version) in order to determine the binding constant. Two experimental setups are considered: a series of vials with different ligand concentrations and the same protein concentration or titration of protein with repeating addition of equal amounts of ligand solution.
