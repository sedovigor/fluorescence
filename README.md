# fluorescence
A Mathematica notebook that can be used to fit the experimental fluorescence quenching data to a given protein-ligand binding model (the most common 1:1 model is employed in this version) in order to determine the binding constant. Two experimental setups are considered: a series of vials with different ligand concentrations and the same protein concentration or titration of protein with repeating addition of equal amounts of ligand solution.
The program determines the value of the binding constant Ka by finding the best fit for the experimental values of fluorescence ratios F0/F. This ratio is typically used in the Stern-Volmer plots. However, it does not use Stern-Volmer equation and solves a system of equations taking into account the fact that the equilibrium ligand concentration is different from the initial. The obtained binding constant Ka can be compared with the slope of Stern-Volmer equation, which is also given in the output.
